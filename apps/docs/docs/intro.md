# Overview of NextCMS

NextCMS is a `Composable Content Platform`. It is more than a CMS, and a Headless CMS. It includes all the capabilities and functionalities of both the CMS and Headless CMS with extended API support.

## Motivation Behind NextCMS

Traditional CMS architecture was once the standard for web development, but today companies are looking for the increased flexibility and scalability provided by headless content management systems. Learn the differences between traditional CMSes, headless CMSes, and the next generation of content management tools — API-first composable content platforms.

## What does it mean to be a Composable Content Platform

Going beyond the traditional CMS and Headless CMS architecture is our aim at NextCMS. Composable Content Platform is the next evolution of content management. Like a headless content management system, it doesn’t take the traditional approach of organizing content around pages. Instead, it centers on structured content in the form of a content model. A content model defines and organizes content into different content types, or building blocks. These content models are tailored to the needs of each organization, so that content creators aren’t stuck with the overly prescriptive page templates of a traditional CMS.

With this we will be able to achieve the following which were not possible using the traditional CMSes

1. Unify content into a single content hub
2. Enable collaborative workflows
3. Increase reusability and scalability

## What are the use cases?

- Support Portal and Knowledge base
- Content Hub
- Modern Stack Website
- Agile eCommerce
- Global Marketing and Localization
- Digital Delivery Platform
